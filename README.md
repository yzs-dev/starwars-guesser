# 🌌 StarWars: Guesser

> "Do or do not. There is no try." – Yoda

Welcome to **StarWars: Guesser**, a galactic twist on the classic word-guessing game. In this universe, your mission is to guess the hidden word before all the programming languages fall victim to the dark side of Assembly!

## 🎉 May the Fourth Be With You!

On this most special of days — **May the 4th** — we celebrate the Force, rebellion, and resistance against all odds. Play a round in honor of the Jedi, outwit the Empire, and may your guesses be as sharp as a lightsaber!

💫 *“May the Force be with you.”*

## 🕹️ How to Play

- A random word is selected from the Star Wars lexicon.
- You have **8 attempts** to guess the word by selecting letters.
- Each wrong guess causes a programming language to fall — and if you fail, **Assembly** rises.
- Can you save the galaxy?

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 Dynamic language chips representing programming languages.
- 🎭 Visual and auditory feedback for each guess.
- 🎉 Confetti victory animations when the game is won.
